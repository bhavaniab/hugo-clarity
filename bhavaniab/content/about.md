Welcome to my world of technology!

Iâ€™m an enthusiastic and self-motivated Software Engineer with a passion for building cutting-edge innovative products related to Embedded Systems.

In a career spanning over 8 years in Embedded Software technologies, I got involved in taking the ownership and leading entire software development lifecycle of projects from Requirement Analysis, Product Design, Writing Code, Writing Automation Tests, Documentation, Debugging and fixing issues to release of the product to the customer.

I have a passion for innovation with a proven track record of publications in the international journals and conferences, in the areas of Signal Processing, Data Mining, and Machine learning.

I aspire to build new products that would leverage my unique background in Software, Hardware, and Machine Learning that would make a significant impact on the end user and the customer.

I enjoy solving complex problems and actively participate in programming challenges.
